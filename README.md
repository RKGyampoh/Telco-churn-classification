Overview


Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This application uses machine learning models trained on telco customer data to provide predictions and insights. It includes a pre-processing pipeline and multiple classification models to analyze customer behavior.


Features

Interactive Interface: Built using Streamlit, offering a simple layout for predictions.

Multi-Model Prediction: Supports different machine learning models such as:

Random Forest (RF)

Support Vector Machine (SVC)

Gradient Boosting (GB)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression (LR)

Bagging Classifier

Preprocessing Pipeline: Automates data preprocessing, including encoding and scaling.

Models

The following machine learning models are included:

Random Forest (RF): A robust ensemble model.

Support Vector Machine (SVC): Suitable for high-dimensional data.

Gradient Boosting (GB): For accurate predictions on small datasets.

Logistic Regression (LR): A simple and interpretable model.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For instance-based learning.

Bagging Classifier: Combines the predictions of multiple base learners.

All models are pre-trained and stored in the models/ directory. The app dynamically loads the model pipeline and pre-trained models using pickle.
